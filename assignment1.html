        <p>My name is Richmond Ofoe. I am 19 years old. I am a first-year biomedical engineering student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science And Technology with student ID:21109888. I come from Big Ada in the Greater Accra region but currently reside at Ayeduase Newsite. I come from a Christian home of four siblings. My second cycle education took place at Wesley Grammar School where i offered general science and graduted in the year 2023.</p>
        <p>From my young age, I have been passionate about healthcare, the human body and all its related fields. I am also enthusiastic when it comes to programming as well as fixing and assembling parts. Having considered all these, I chose to pursue Biomedical Engineering which entails the application of engineering principles in healthcare to solve engineering related health issues. However, I chose to pursue this my hankering aspiration at KNUST, an institution premiere in engineering not only in Ghana but Africa at large. </p>
        <p>With the knowledge and skills I tend to acquire in this university, I aspire to be a Biomedical equipment engineer in the fields of robotics and medical devicing.</p>
